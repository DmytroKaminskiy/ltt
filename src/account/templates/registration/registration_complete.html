                            things could have happened:
                        </p>

                            <li>
                                The email is in your spam folder. (Sometimes things get lost in there.)
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                The email address you entered had a mistake or typo. (Happens to the best of us.)
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                You accidentally gave us another email address. (Usually a work or personal one
                                instead of the one you meant.)
                            </li>
